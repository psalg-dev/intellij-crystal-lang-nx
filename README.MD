# Crystal Language Plugin for Intellij 2024+

Plugin is under development. 
Existing Intellij Plugins for Crystal are not actively maintained and
are not compatible with later versions of Intellij. 
This project aims to provide an alternative while building on what's already available in existing plugins.

# Why Java
Although JetBrains promotes the use of Kotlin for plugin development, we chose Java for this project
in the hopes that it will be easier for others to contribute and keep this alive across upcoming versions of Intellij.
